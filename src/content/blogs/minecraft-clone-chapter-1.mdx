# Minecraft Clone: Chapter 1

## An Introduction

For the past few weeks, I have been working on my <Link text="OpenGL Minecraft Clone" href="https://github.com/kewin-y/kewin-craft" />; my first "real" C++ project.[^1] Admittedly, I haven't been giving this project as much attention as I would like to; many features seem daunting to implement (due to my inexperience) and I have been using my summer to focus on summer courses. Despite this, it has been quite the fun learning experience. This blog post serves as a devlog for the project's (very) early stages.

## Drawing a Chunk

As I am working with C++ and OpenGL, I have no way to easily instantiate a cube mesh to render a block; I must set everything up from scratch. Thankfully, this wasn't too bad. I've worked with OpenGL in the past, and I can just re-use my old code ...

However, I decided to render an entire chunk of blocks at once. Minecraft-like games usually use a chunking system to optimally render thousands of blocks. I knew I was going to implement one, and it would be better do it early. Plus, there isn't a big technical gap between a chunk and block; a chunk of many blocks can just be thought of as an array of blocks. However, I did put off texture-rendering since I thought it would be a big headache.

Following the <Link text="Learn OpenGL" href="https://learnopengl.com/" /> tutorial, I was able to implement a camera, to hopefully see my chunk in all of its glory. I compiled and ran my code and here is what I was met with:

<p align="center" >
    <Image
        src={sliced_chunk}
        alt="A failed chunk implementation"
        width="500"
        height="300"
    />
</p>

Thankfully, this error was easy to fix. I was working with a flat array to store the blocks of the chunk, calculating block's coordinates within the chunk based off it's index. It turned out that I was assigning the z-coordinate of a block to its y-coordinate, leaving the former completely alone.

```cpp
// My code looked something like this:
x = /* Calculate x coordinate */
y = /* Calculate y coordinate */
y = /* Calculate z coordinate */
```

After fixing this little goof, I was able to see my chunk:

<p align="center" >
    <Image
        src={nice_chunk}
        alt="A chunk implementation"
        width="500"
        height="300"
    />
</p>

## A Bit of a Problem ...

At this point, my code was horribly optimized. Yes, I did have a beautiful blue cube, but my poor little laptop did not like it. I was rendering way too many vertices for only one chunk. To put things in perspective, one block has 6 faces. Each face contains 2 triangles. Each triangle contains 3 vertices. Therefore, in each block, there are 6 * 2 * 3 = 36 vertices. Each side of my chunk is 32 blocks large, so it contains 32^3 = 32768 blocks. In total, that's 36 x 32768 = 1179648 vertices!

## The First Optimizations

The first optimization that I implemented was to only render faces which are adjacent to air blocks. This was very simple to implement, only requiring a couple of if-statements. However, the results were extremely impressive. After implementing this optimization, I only needed to render 36858 vertices!

## Chunk Management

Now, it was time to render many chunks. I put this task off for so many weeks because I didn't know what data structure to represent the chunks. I've seen people use vectors to store the chunk, as in <Link text="this article" href="https://sites.google.com/site/letsmakeavoxelengine/home/chunk-management?authuser=0"/>, but many other data structures were suggested, from octrees to hash maps. After weeks of procrastination, I decided to use a hash map (more appropriately, `std::unordered_map`). It made the most sense to me; I could easily look up chunks in (near) constant time given their coordinates. After an afternoon of coding, I was able to render multiple chunks.

<p align="center" >
    <Image
        src={many_chunks}
        alt="many chunks"
        width="500"
        height="300"
    />
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    Rendering chunks with a render distance of 2. I also changed the colour of the blocks.
</div>

Despite this breakthrough, my code was still horribly unoptimized. I usually play with a render distance of around 8-12 in Minecraft, but applying the same settings to my clone brought my laptop to its knees (I was getting less than 2 FPS 😬). Even though I was able to render multiple chunks, I did not have the energy to implement chunk loading and unloading or world generation ...

## Afterword

That about summarizes what I have been doing with my C++ OpenGL Minecraft clone. Not a lot of progress has been made since it's conception in early May, but that's partly due to my inexperience. I want to learn a lot more about game engine development and C++ to hopefully speed up the pace of this project. By the next devlog, I aim to have implemented some semblance of chunk loading and procedural world generation. Thank you for reading this devlog 😊.
